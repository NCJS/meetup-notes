## What is VS Code?

VS Code (or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) is an open source editor developed by Microsoft and includes a variety of powerful options.

VS Code is based on [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)) which combines the [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) rendering engine with [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) runtime allowing for GUI applications to be developed on the desktop. Although it uses the Electron framework, [Atom](https://atom.io/) is not used - the editor utilizes the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).

Out of the box, VS Code has support for almost every major programing language. With the language specific limitations outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code). For those concerned about data collection checkout the alternative - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), a 100% open source version of VS Code.

VS Code is generally known for its 4 main features which include IntelliSense, Debugging, Built-in Git, and access to extensions - which we will continue talking about later on, when we discuss customization.

## Why is it relevant?

Over 50% of all Stack Overflow users report they develop with Visual Studio Code in the [2019 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) (up from 7.2% in 2016). This shows how quickly this editor has gained in popularity over the last few years.

[Another statistic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode): VS Code's extension for Python currently has 63.1M downloads.

## How to start customizing

An overview of the VS Code setup process can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

To get a good introduction, you can checkout [the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos).

Looking around the editor we see: the editor group (center), activity bar (left), status bar (bottom), and panel (hidden).

#### Activity Bar

The activity bar has a few options to select from:

##### Explorer

Where we can view files, folder structure and more.

##### Find

A search replace tool that can be used to find and replace anything within a specified file.

##### Source Control

Keep track of changes that have been made locally.

##### Debug

Debug your code.

##### Extensions

[Extend](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) VS Code to add languages, debuggers, and tools.

### Command Palette

To open files, & access commands use the keyboard shortcut - `ctrl+shift+p` and search for the option you are looking for.

### Custom Themes

You can customize the way the editor looks which is helpful for development.

Click the gear icon in the bottom left, and select Color Theme. From here you can choose one of the standard themes that comes default with VS Code. To look for other themes, you can do so by searching in the extensions.

### Key-bindings & keyboard shortcuts

It is possible to customize or set custom keyboard shortcuts in VS Code. To do so, access the command palette and search for `keyboard shortcuts`then select the option to edit keyboard shortcuts in preferences.

### IntelliSense

This is a general term that is used for a variety of code editing features including code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. VS Code comes in handy when you are working on a project, and would like these specific features for the language you are developing with.

### Zen mode

Use this to minimize distractions & focus on the code. Use the command palette to search for zen mode & enable this option.

### Git integration

VS Code has support for Git out of the box, and other extensions can be installed for other source control providers.

Within the source control tab, we can see changes as well as options to interact with the source.

The status bar in the bottom left hand corner displays the branch & gives us the option to pull down the most recent changes to the remote. If there is no upstream branch we see the Publish action which gives us the ability to publish the current branch to a remote.

When dealing with a merge conflict, VS Code highlights the differences and we are given the option to choose which changes we want to keep.

### HTML & CSS

[Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) comes default with VS Code & allows us to write HTML & CSS more quickly.

### Snippet introduction

Define preferences in File > Preferences > Settings

[This](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) will help develop shortcuts for repetitive functions

### Pair programming

Opportunity to install extensions and can integrate with Slack to chat as well. Anyone want to try this with me?

### Sync Git Settings

This can be done with an extension and ensures that if you are setting up a new workspace or working with different machines - you can still rely on the what you have already set up.

### Macros

Within the user settings you can define macros which will help automate repetitive tasks.

For example:

`"macros": {

​        "collapseAndClose": [

​            "workbench.files.action.collapseExplorerFolders",

​            "workbench.action.closeAllEditors"

​        ]

​    },`

will collapse all of the folders and close all of the open files.
