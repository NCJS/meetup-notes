## Trails Platform

[https://gis.nevcounty.net/arcgis/rest/services/web_public/Open_Data_Layers_Nevada_County/MapServer/1400/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=\*&outSR=4326&f=json](https://gis.nevcounty.net/arcgis/rest/services/web_public/Open_Data_Layers_Nevada_County/MapServer/1400/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=json)

The concept for the group project is an app that allows users to interact with the trails in Nevada County. The specific features are still yet to be determined.

Framework we will use- Vue.js

**Setting up your machine for the project:**

Prerequisites: npm/nvm, basic knowledge of git - willingness to learn
