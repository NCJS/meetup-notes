# The WP Block Editor

"Thanks for coming out here today guys! I My name is Kory Richardson, I do custom WP development"

Today I will be talking a bit about the WP block editor - originally called the 'Gutenburg editor' & building custom blocks with JavaScript. 

So, is anyone here familiar with the block editing experience in WP?

---

If you aren't familiar please go to - https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ to try it out.

So this page shows all of the options for the different blocks that can be used within the block editor. Paragraph, heading, subheading, etc. This update went into production in November, as kind of an attempt to match the progress of other page building experiences like Squarespace, Wix, and Webflow. 

So from here we will jump into how to create-guten-block with [@AhmadAwais](https://github.com/ahmadawais) - credit to [@andreas-groos](https://github.com/orgs/NCJS/people/andreas-groos) for sharing this with me as well as some code to get started. 

So out of the box:

"What's included?

- React, JSX, and ES6 syntax support.
- webpack dev/production build process behind the scene.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Auto-prefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production with source-maps.
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency `cgb-scripts`."



[How to build a Gutenburg block with npx](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block) 

basically cd into the plugin directory in WP (wp-content/plugins)

- ```
  npx create-guten-block my-block
  ```

- ```
  cd my-block
  ```

- ```
  npm start
  ```



This will pretty much set you up to start building. We can then `cd` into the `src` directory and update the code. 

So, looking at the `block.js` file

My file changes can be seen in: lines 

14: PlainText constant

31: change the dashicon

38-42:  attribute - text

55-62: Get editor content

75-77: Display editor content



As well as styles in the `editor.scss` & `style.scss`

So if we log into the WP dashboard, and create a page we can then add in the block we created.

Save.

And view page. 

Tada!
