# Web Performance Optimization

Presented by [Chris Campbell](https://github.com/christophertcampbell) - August 27, 2019

Example code for the frontend images portion of the talk is available in my [Talks repo](https://github.com/christophertcampbell/talks).

## Overview

Web performance is a constant consideration when design web-based applications.  Even if you may be on a blazing fast network, your audience may not be!  And mobile devices (a major audience) typically have slower connections.

2 typical cases:

* New application design.  Design for performance from the start.
* Need to speed up a slow, existing application

## Where Do I Start

* Seat-of-the-pants: You will know when a site or UI is too slow!
* Evaluate using Network tab of browser Developer Tools
* Report by Google Lighthouse or similar analysis utility

**Tip:** Go to simple solutions first. Save complex programming, custom caching, etc until they are truly needed... the less code, the easier it will be to maintain.

## Frontend

1. **Images**
	* Resize images, no larger than necessary
	* Use responsive images (srcset="") to serve smaller images at smaller screen sizes
	* Serve next-gen images to modern browsers (.webp images served via `<picture>`)
	* Lazy load images that are below-the-fold
		* Use JS library, or native browser lazy loading via `loading="lazy"`
1. **YouTube Videos**
	* Embeded videos load with every page load, even if below-the-fold and never clicked
	* Use a lazy load library, or use the YouTube Javascript API
1. **CSS and JS Resources**
	* Use minified versions
	* Minimize use of multiple libraries (multiple requests)
	* Create smaller, targeted builds of pieces of larger libraries if not using the entire library
1. **Web Fonts**
	* Minimize number of web fonts used
	* Watch size of web fonts (vary from 20kb to 400+kb)
	* Use system font stacks instead of web fonts where appropriate
1. **Pre-connect to External Resources**
	* Establishes a connection to external providers before they are encountered during the parsing of the DOM
	* `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" crossorigin>`
1. **CDN**
	* Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and deliver your site and/or assets faster
1. **Gzip**
	* Serve resources in compressed gzip format if the server supports it. Significantly smaller files sizes.

## Backend

1. **Cache Data**
	* Cache un-changing information rather than repeatedly requesting from API or database
2. **Optimize Code**
	* Evaluate flow of code / logic for bottlenecks
	* Complex analysis may require stepping through code as it runs, watching performance analysis, monitoring memory usage, etc
3. **CMS Gotchas (Wordpress, etc)**
	* Choose / develop a theme that is optimized for speed
	* Minimize use of plugins
	* Develop plugins to only load resources where they are needed
	* Disable pseudo-CRON jobs that randomly slow page loads.  Replace with real CRON jobs set up through the cPanel.
